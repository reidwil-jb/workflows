## Lint

The lint.yaml workflow is built for analytics teams who have github repositories for their SQL code ([dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [snowchanger](https://github.com/phdata/snowchange/blob/master/snowchange.py)). 
The workflow uses `diff-quality` find **only new** files from a pull request relative to the default branch on the repository (main, master, development). It will lint those files and return a tidy comment on the pull request.

This process currently is dependent on:

   1. action/checkout@v2

   2. [SQLfluff](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff) for linting

   3. [Khan's pull request trigger](https://github.com/Khan/pull-request-comment-trigger)

   4. [octions's post comments](https://github.com/maxkomarychev/octions#read-input-from-file)
  
## How To:

To trigger this action you must type `/lint` on a pull request comment. If you want to change the trigger, adjust [here](https://github.com/reidwil-jb/workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint.yml#L21)

You should see a rocket ðŸš€ emote on your comment and subsequently message like:
````
